	<h2>Profiles in Coverage: Quantitative Refactoring</h2>
	<p>Coverage tools are a great way to see what parts of your code are accessed under certain conditions (for instance, what classes or methods are executed when you run a suite of unit tests). Profiling tools measure and find performance issues (i.e. what percent of time is spent in what classes or methods during a normal runtime of your application). From time to time, you need to mix both these types of tools together. Let me give you an example...</p>
	<h3>The Legacy Classpath</h3>
	<p>My current employer has been around for ~7 years. The primary product is a web application comprised of a number of services...each service is deployed as a Java web app. Each of these services has different endpoints and servlet paths descirbed by a web.xml unique to each service. The classpath for each of these apps, however, is identical...even though each web app instance resides in it's own standalone servlet container.</p>
	<p>By factoring out  the shape or interface of an application from the classpath structure by way of the application configuration, one can create multiple applications or endpoints from a single codebase. It is not an uncommon approach in enterprisey software, and is arguably a nice feature of the Java webapp standard</p>
	<p>However, a downside of this approach is seen when one attempts to refactor or re-implement one of these applications. Let's say, for example, there is a constituent webservice in this set of applications that would be better served by a non-Java implementation. Perhaps one of these services is highly parallelized and must run in compliance with a severe operational SLA - a domain arguably better suited to a language and runtime like Erlang. How easy is it to detemine what components and classes are to be replaces, refactored or deleted?</p>
	<p>While the application's entry points (servlets and JSPs) are clearly defined by the Java web apps web.xml descriptor, the totality of the runtime dependencies are less clear. Some static dependency analysis can be performed, but throw in a dependency injection container like Spring or PicoContainer, and things get complex in a hurry. A possible solution, as hinted at in the first paragrpah, is empirical observation through the coverage and profiling tools.</p>
	<p>Let's consider what information we would need to support our refactoring:
		<ul>
			<li>catalogue of all classes loaded by application and container classloaders at runtime</li>
			<li>list of methods invoked during a given runtime period of the application</li>
			<li>invocation count, per method, during a given runtime of the application</li>
			<li>breakdown/rollup of the invocation counts at by package/package level</li>
			
		</ul></p>
		<p>Existing coverage tools like Emma and Cobertura do provide, in various formats, the first two items in the list...and profiling tools like the built-in Eclipse utilities do provide basic precentages and proportional time metrics, if not actual raw invocation counts. But I don't know of any simple tooling that provides both. Is there a way to access that data via a single tool? Can we perform such analysis without a massive amount of effort and coding? Let's take a look at one approach..
<h3>Rolling Your Own Instrumentation</h3>			
<p>As of JDK 1.5, there is a pretty simple <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html">hook</a> to perform bytecode instrumentation <i>at runtime</i>. This allows you to add intrusive diagnostics w/o generating persistent mutated artifacts. This is a good thing as the danger with compile-time instrumentation is that it becomes possible to inadvertently deploy a mutated binary into production. Limiting instrumentation to runtime makes the instrumentation a deploy-time decision and greatly reduces operational risk for shops doing continuous builds and deployments. It isn't hard to add a hook...we simply write a  class with a <i>premain(String agentArguments, java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation)</i> method that will be called at  the start of your JVM to register an implementation of <i>java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer</i>. The ClassFileTransformer implementation will be granted access to each compiled class file as it is loaded by the JVM's classloader(s), and can modify/mutate the binary data using JVM bytcode manipulation libraries such as <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/">ASM</a>  or Oolong. Adding a catalogue of all loaded classes and a log of each method invocation can be implemented in just a few lines of code and a handful of classes. To load, instrument and run your app, simply package your instrumentation implementation classes into a jar with <a href="http://github.com/igb/Profiles-In-Coverage/raw/master/config/usage-map-manifest.mf">a manifest</a> indicating the entry class (the one with the <i>premain</i> method) and reference the jar using the <i>javaagent</i> option. Don't worry too much about the implementation details now, for the time being you can use  <a href="http://github.com/igb/Profiles-In-Coverage">the instrumentation code we hacked together for this article</a>.</p>
